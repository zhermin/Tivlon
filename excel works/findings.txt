to-ask:
    - endgoal: for the excel file to be entirely user-friendly? (ie, who is reading the excel file)
	- make new employees / interns learn excel?
	- how are the other interns helping
    - need to chart the raw prices?

    *** CURRENT MANUAL WORK (STEP BY STEP SO FAR + END RESULT)
	> what data of prices of (ports/cities/etc?) obtained from data company
	> whether format of raw data consistent
	> how often completely new data is added (new ports / new products in ports)
	> what happens to the old data
	> the column manipulations done
	    >> manually copied and pasted chosen columns into new worksheet for calculations & analysis?
	> what happens to the results? (what does the report consist?)
	    >> tools & their usefulness thus far (tableau?)

    * how new data is received > affects how easily able to refresh warehosue
	- able to simply add or reference raw data from master data to update the pivot tables

    * google sheets vs excel
	- google sheets : no unpivot unless manual/macro
	- so far no need vba (maybe macro to unpivot all the data)

















[GOAL]
selection process:
    a. benchmark
        i. port
	ii. column
    b. up to x5
	i. port
	ii. column
    c. function
	i. all [b] vs [a]
    d. time frame
    
results:
    a. calculated columns of [b] vs [a]
	i. either in new excel sheet / file
	ii. to be removed after analysis is completed?
    b. charting [b] vs [a]
	i. excel
	ii. export to tableau as calculated dataframe and combine to one chart


[FAILURES]

tried options
1. leave the sheets as they are (tbl)
    - unable to set worksheet as parameter to select the column from said worksheet (???)
    - reason being graph is created after selecting the sheets
    - thus comparison can only be within one sheet

2. combine and merge all sheets into one dataset (tbl)
    - problems : * need to get sheet with the most rows (most dates) to be referenced upon
                 * can't just merge with pandas / tableau onto the first sheet
                 * (1st sheet, huanghua only has 321 dates compared to rizhao 3000+ dates)
    + allows selection from all ports
    - don't think the parameters can be dyanamic
    - to set few extra graphs to be plotted against the benchmark + the selected function = wtf?

3. excel/sheets + vba/gas to do dynamic inputs (back to square one)


testings so far:
    - 1. and 2.
    - python pandas
	* removed useless rows
	* translate headers
	* tried merging all worksheets
	    > ended up with problem in 2.
	* tried transposing the merged worksheet to add [port] filter
	    > can't figure out how to add additional filters to filter by ports
	    > tableau doesn't accept multiple headers

    - thinking of data warehouse and outputs being different excel files
    - output file includes pivot tables and charts reading the data warehouse
